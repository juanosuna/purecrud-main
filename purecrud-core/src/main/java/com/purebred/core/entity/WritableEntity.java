/**
 * Base class for entities that are writable by end users.
 * <p/>
 * This class requires that entities use a generated Long id as the primary key. This is a surrogate key
 * that should have no business meaning.
 * <p/>
 * It also generates a unique UUID that is used in the default equals and hashcode logic. Developers are free
 * to override this logic and use their own logic based on business keys, which is the "ideal" best practice.
 * However, the UUID approach also correctly solves the equality problem where transient and non-transient entities
 * are compared and/or added to collections.
 * Even though these UUIDs seem like clutter in the database, they pragmatically relieve developers
 * from having to properly implement equals/hashcode by identifying business keys for every entity.
 * Of course, even with the UUIDs, developers should make sure to annotate business keys so that unique
 * constraints are generated in the DDL, even if these business keys are not used in equals/hashcode.
